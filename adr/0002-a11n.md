## Context and Problem Statement

Currently APT relies on a all or nothing permission system. Logged in users can do anything while anonymous users have their actions restricted.
In the future this will be improved and support for granular permission will be added.
We need a system that is simple enough to setup for the current use case, but that can scale easily.

## Decision Drivers

- Simple to use
- Established with good documentation

## Considered Options

- CASL

## Decision Outcome

Chosen "CASL" given the familiarity with the technology. It is simple to use and reason about, and its small API makes it easy to learn if unknown to other participants in the project.

### Positive Consequences

- Well documented
- Does only one thing (Permission handling)
- Simple API

### Negative Consequences

- No other options were considered
